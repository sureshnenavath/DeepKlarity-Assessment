  "summary": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its emphasis on code readability and support for multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, Python has evolved significantly, with Python 3.0 released in 2008 marking a major revision that is not fully backward-compatible. The language is widely used in various fields, particularly in machine learning, and has consistently ranked among the most popular programming languages globally. Python's design philosophy promotes simplicity and extensibility, making it a favored choice for both beginners and experienced developers.",
